This repository contains a collection of prompts designed to help learners progress from **beginner to advanced Python programming**.
It also includes the **system prompt for ZapGPT**, tailored to provide structured and secure Python code generation.

## üìÇ Repository Contents

- **`python_learning_prompts.md`**
  A collection of prompts that guide learners step-by-step through Python concepts, with examples and best practices.
  Covers everything from variables and loops to advanced topics like classes, decorators, and memory management.

- **`zapgpt_system_prompt.json`**
  A carefully designed system prompt for ZapGPT, enforcing:
  - Python best practices
  - PEP-8 compliant code
  - Secure coding principles
  - Example-driven explanations

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Learning Python with Prompts
Use the prompts in `python_learning_prompts.md` with your preferred LLM (such as ChatGPT, Claude, or ZapGPT) to learn Python interactively.
Each prompt:
- Introduces a concept
- Provides a practical example
- Encourages hands-on experimentation

Example:
```text
Explain Python variables with an example. Use `var str: "test"` style notation and follow PEP-8.
````

### 2. Using the ZapGPT System Prompt

Load the `zapgpt_system_prompt.md` into ZapGPT (or another compatible model) to ensure all generated code:

* Defaults to Python
* Includes comments, error handling, and secure practices
* Adds a file header with author, date, and documentation


Included in ZapGPT by default.
## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

* Any LLM that supports system prompts (e.g., ZapGPT, OpenAI GPT models, Anthropic Claude).
* Basic knowledge of Markdown to navigate the prompts.

## üìñ Learning Path

The Python prompts are structured as a **progressive learning journey**:

1. **Beginner** ‚Äì Variables, Data Types, Operators, Loops
2. **Intermediate** ‚Äì Functions, Error Handling, File I/O
3. **Advanced** ‚Äì OOP, Decorators, Generators, Context Managers
4. **Expert** ‚Äì Memory Management, Concurrency, Security, Optimization

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

* Add new prompts for missing Python concepts.
* Improve existing prompts with better examples.
* Suggest refinements for the ZapGPT system prompt.
